Either paste the code to your $profile and make a function for it... 
```function winfetch{....}``` or you can just download it and link the path of this .ps1 file to your $profile 

```
function winfetch {
    & 'path-here'
}
```
To open your $profile file type  ```code $profile``` or ```notepad $profile``` according to your favorite text editor
*Powershell 7 and nerdfonts are recommended*
